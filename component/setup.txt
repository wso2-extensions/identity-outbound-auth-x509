Product: WSO2 IS authenticator for X509 Certificate
Pre-requisites:

- Maven 3.x
- Java 1.6 or above

Tested Platform: 

- UBUNTU 14.04
- WSO2 IS 5.1.0
- Java 1.7

Do the following:

1. Navigate to identity-outbound-auth-x509/org.wso2.carbon.identity.authenticator.x509Certificate and build.

2. Place org.wso2.carbon.extension.identity.authenticator.x509Certificate.connector jar into
    <IS_HOME>/repository/components/dropins.

3. Edit the <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/identity/identity-mgt.properties directory and add the servlet url following property.
   x509-certificate-servlet=https://localhost:8443/x509-certificate-servlet

4. Add a cliammapping for Certificate with mapping to any string attribute eg(eg:nickName)

                Description	       Certificate of the user
                Claim Uri	       http://wso2.org/claims/userCertificate

                Regular Expression     null
                Display Order	       0
                Supported by Default   false
                Required	       false

5. Navigate to <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat and Edit the catalina-server.xml of your Tomcat and add the following
    connector (change the path to your jks file):
                <Connector
                        protocol="HTTP/1.1"
                        port="8443" maxThreads="200"
                        scheme="https" secure="true" SSLEnabled="true"
                        keystoreFile="/path/to/keystore.jks" keystorePass="keystorepwd"
                        truststoreFile="/path/to/truststore.jks" truststorePass="cacertspassword"
                        clientAuth="want" sslProtocol="TLS"/>

6. Start the IS server and create Identity provider and service provider in IS via the IS console.



Prepare keystore
----------------

1.Create a CA
*First check wether you have installed openssl by issuing
   openssl version -d
*Create a key pair
   openssl genrsa -out ca.key 1024
Sample input for the command

 $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:SK
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Bratislava
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Bratislava
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Naive
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:CA
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:CA Admin
Email Address []:ca@naive.sk
As a result you will get root certificate ca.crt that will be imported to the browser.

2.Create a server certificate
*Create key pair
  openssl genrsa -out localhost.key 2048

*Create a certificate signing request
 openssl req -new -key localhost.key -out localhost.csr

Sample input
$ openssl req -new -key localhost.key -out localhost.csr
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:SK
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Bratislava
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Bratislava
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Other Company
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:localhost
Email Address []:admin@other.sk

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:
*Creating a certificate
 openssl ca -keyfile ca.key -cert ca.crt -out localhost.crt -policy
Sample input
 $ openssl ca -keyfile ca.key -cert ca.crt -out localhost.crt -policy policy_anything -infiles localhost.csr
Using configuration from /usr/lib/ssl/openssl.cnf
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok
Certificate Details:
...too long
Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y

*Getting a pkcs12 out of .crt file.That file will be used to import certificates into java keystore and import into browser
 keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass changeit -destkeypass changeit  -destkeystore keystore.jks
    -srckeystore ../../certtest/localhost.p12  -srcstoretype PKCS12 -alias sercer

*Create a java key store with the server certificate(localhost.crt)
 keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass changeit -destkeypass changeit  -destkeystore keystore.jks
    -srckeystore ../../certtest/localhost.p12  -srcstoretype PKCS12 -alias sercer

 3.Create a client certificate
* Follow the above discription until you get .p12 file
4.Export the CA to java key store.
*keytool -import -keystore kestore.jks -storepass changeit -alias my_ca -file ../../certtest/ca.crt
